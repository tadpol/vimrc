This is a quick hack at syntax highlighting for the OpenSCAD 3D modeling language -- http://www.openscad.org/

Note that at the moment it doesn&#039t help detect errors such as mismatched blocks and parens.

TODOs include error management and quickfix/compiler support.

I would appreciate feedback and suggestions for improvement, please use the script wiki link above.

The plugin is hosted on github, see https://github.com/sirtaj/vim-openscad
